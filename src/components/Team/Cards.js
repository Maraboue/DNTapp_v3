                        <p>Gustaf is a computer engineer who has been in crypto since 2013. With a passion for coding and economics, crypto became his greatest interest early on.<br/><br/>
                            What started as a thesis project for a degree in computer engineering he later evolved into the Dynamic Network, with the vision of a more
                            secure way for people to invest in the crypto space. With the other members of the team, he will now do everything to pursuit this vision.</p>

                        <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.<br/>
                            The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here',
                            making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text.</p>
